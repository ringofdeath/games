# games
This will be a archive of games I make and the first one was made as of 9/6/2021. 
I'm still figuring out how to use github
IMPORTANT:These games can be used freely and shared if I eventully make a good one, I'll only ever post games on here that I plan to keep free.
I will post if I do plan to  make or have already released a full game that is being sold.(I only ever plan to sell like a 3d game like Call Of Duty[I mean in the aspect of a shooter game but I want a lot of effort in it]) 

Thanks Yall
